# PREDICTING-RATINGS-USING-YELP-DATA

**Yelp Dataset Multi-label Classification** shows star rating predictions on the business review count, total number of checkins, state and city where business is located. The app utilizes the Yelp Dataset for all businesses which includes over 1.2 million business attributes like hours, parking, availability, and ambience. Moreover, aggregated check-ins over time for each of the 156,000 businesses is also provided in different JSON files in the dataset. My aim is to first find the relevant factors that influence a business’s rating. Using this, I train a model to predict users’ rating of a business. The motivation includes that if I can predict how a user is going to rate a business, then I can recommend the business that the user is more likely to rate higher than the others
